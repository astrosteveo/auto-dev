    "overall": "The assertions cover the core workflow phases well and the executor performed genuinely thorough work. The main gap is that assertion 6 (drift detection/update) would benefit from a test case where PROGRESS.md is actually stale relative to git, forcing a real update rather than a 'no drift found' statement. The assertions also lean toward checking that steps were performed rather than checking the quality of their output."
